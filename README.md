This tutorial will help you guide through the initial setup of Active Directory on Azure Virtual Machines

---

## What You‚Äôll Be Using

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines and Networking)
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
- Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
- PowerShell

---

## Operating Systems We‚Äôll Work With

- Windows Server 2022 (for the Domain Controller)
- Windows 10 (21H2) (for the Client)

---

## Step 1: Create a Resource Group

- Head over to the **Azure Portal**.
- Navigate to **Resource Groups** and hit *Create*.
- Give it a name ‚Äî I went with `Active-D`.
- Pick your favorite region (like `East US`).

## Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Network and Subnet

- Go to **Virtual Networks** and click *Create*.
- Fill in these details:
  - Name: `AD-VNet`
  - Address space: `10.0.0.0/16`
  - Subnet name: `AD-Subnet`
  - Subnet range: `10.0.1.0/24`
  - Make sure it‚Äôs in the same region as your Resource Group.

## Step 3: Create Your Domain Controller VM (`dc-1`)

- Go to **Virtual Machines** > *Create*.
- Set it up like this:
  - Name: `dc-1`
  - Image: Windows Server 2022
  - Username: `labuser`
  - Password: `Cyberlab123!` (make sure to pick your own strong password in real setups)
  - Region: same as your VNet
  - Size: `Standard_D2s_v3` (2 CPUs, 8 GB RAM)
  - Virtual Network: `AD-VNet`
  - Subnet: `AD-Subnet`
  - Public IP: Enabled (so you can RDP in)
  - Allow RDP inbound on port 3389

---

## Step 4: Lock Down the Domain Controller‚Äôs IP

- Once the VM‚Äôs up, open **dc-1** in the Azure Portal.
- Go to **Networking** > **IP Configurations**.
- Change the Private IP allocation from dynamic to **Static**.

Now, connect via RDP to `dc-1`:

- Open Windows Defender Firewall (`wf.msc`).
- For now (since this is a lab), disable the firewall on **Domain**, **Private**, and **Public** profiles.

---

## Step 5: Create Your Client VM (`client-1`)

- Back to **Virtual Machines** > *Create*.
- Configure it like this:
  - Name: `client-1`
  - Image: Windows 10 (latest)
  - Username: `labuser`
  - Password: `Cyberlab123!`
  - Region: same as `dc-1`
  - Virtual Network: `AD-VNet`
  - Subnet: `AD-Subnet`
  - Public IP: Enabled (for RDP)
  - Allow inbound RDP (port 3389)
This VM will act as the machine you want to join to the domain.

---

## Step 6: Point Client DNS to Your Domain Controller

- In the Azure Portal, open **client-1**.
- Go to **Networking** > **Network Settings** > **DNS Servers**.
- Change from **Default** to **Custom**.
- Enter the private IP address of `dc-1`.
- Hit **Save**, then **restart client-1** for the change to take effect.

## Step 7: Quick Connectivity Check with PowerShell

RDP into `client-1` and open PowerShell:

- Ping the Domain Controller‚Äôs private IP (like `10.0.0.4`) to check connectivity:

</p>

- Run `ipconfig /all` and look for the DNS server entry ‚Äî it should show the Domain Controller‚Äôs IP.

</p>

**You now have the basics in place. From here, you can promote your Domain Controller, join the client to the domain, and explore Active Directory features like user and group management.**
